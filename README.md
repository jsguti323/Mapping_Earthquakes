# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a data visualization that shows the difference in magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world during the previous seven days. Using the Javascript and D3 library, we were able to use a URL for geoJSON earthquake data to retrieve geographical coordinates and magnitudes, then added them to an interactive map using the Leaflet library via an API request.
